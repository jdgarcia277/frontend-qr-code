## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got more practice with media queries for the mobile view. I used the different devices on Google Chromes Dev tools to help with even the smallest of devices. I did not utilize a mobile first approach with this project, but I will in the future.


### Continued development

Mobile First Approach
